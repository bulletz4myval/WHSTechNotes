im honestly feeling so tired of school and trying to finsh it and everything its kinda stressing but im pushing through and trying to finish everything so i can have a better future and be a better person,the most stressful part of school is chemistry trying to do all the science works cause im kinda bad at it.things i do when school gets stressfull i just put my airpods in and drink my monster and try to finsih my work and blast my music,the goal i have for the end of the year when i go to the next grade is to be a better person and come to school everyday and have better grades and i promise myself that to never skip school and do more work and everything cause i learned from my mistakes now,when im feeling overwhelmed  i just talk to my parents or my girlfriend about it or just loisten to music or draw and just do whatever for it to go away cause it really helps.
