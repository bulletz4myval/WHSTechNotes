im honestly feeling so tired of school and trying to finsh it and everything its kinda stressing but im pushing through and trying to finish everything so i can have a better future and be a better person,the most stressful part of school is chemistry trying to do all the science works cause im kinda bad at it.things i do when school gets stressfull i just put my airpods in and drink my monster and try to finsih my work and blast my music,the goal i have for the end of the year when i go to the next grade is to be a better person and come to school everyday and have better grades and i promise myself that to never skip school and do more work and everything cause i learned from my mistakes now,when im feeling overwhelmed  i just talk to my parents or my girlfriend about it or just loisten to music or draw and just do whatever for it to go away cause it really helps.

what i really think about the new cellphone law it really sucks but not really, i can live without my phone but i really need my music tho it helps me through the day or i can just watch youtube on the chromebook or do something else and i just always keep my phone in my pocket like always so the new phone law isnt really that bad at all, i mean my evidence for this if there was an emergency teachers have there phones and the school can do something about it if there was an emegency happening at school but i always keep my phone with me,my reasoning for this is i think we will be fine without our phones for a whole year even tho people will always have them.

for my claim i think my opion for the roblox job thing for ikea is nice and i think it would be a good idea but its only for people who are 18+ and its kind of a bad idea but easy money instead of going out and working,for my evidence i would maybe work there online just for the money and restocking would be easy and i play roblox alot so it would be such a easy job doing this for hours but it would get boring even tho its not supposed to be fun at all i would like it it kinda would be fun stocking shelves,for my reasoning the reason my evidence supports my claim because working on roblox would be a bad idea cause it would just be boring and kinda fun,and i think my opion is it would be a bad idea cause it really wouldnt help on a kids game just staring at a screen for hours and just waiting to get paid by ikea and roblox.
